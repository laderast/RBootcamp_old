## Introduction to dplyr

Remember: Please Join our [RBootcamp OHSU Group!](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/de163cc541d0d9bde4956157d17dbedfb1149225/invite)

We've been looking at datasets that fit the `ggplot2` paradigm nicely; however, most data we encounter 
is really messy (missing values), or is a completely different format. In this chapter, we'll look 
at one of the most powerful tools in the `tidyverse`: `dplyr`, which lets you manipulate data frames. 
There is a function/action for most of the annoying tasks you have to use in data cleaning, which
makes it super useful.

In particular, we're going to look at six fundamental verbs/actions in `dplyr`:

- `filter()`
- `mutate()`
- `group_by()`/`summarize()`
- `arrange()`
- `select()`

Along the way, we'll do some data manipulation challenges. You'll be a `dplyr` expert in no time!

You will want to keep this `dplyr` cheat sheet open in a separate window to remind you about the syntax:
[dplyr cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)

Also, remember: if you need to know the variables in a `data.frame` called `biopics` you can always use 

```{r}
colnames(biopics)
```

If you want more information on a function such as `mutate()`, you can always ask for help:

```{r}
?mutate
```

## A Little Bit about assignment

In order to do the following exercises, we need to learn a little bit about how to assign 
the output of a function to a variable.

For example, we can assign the output of the operation `1 + 2` to a variable called `sumOfTwoNumbers`
using the `<-` operator. This is called the `assignment` operator.

You can also use `=` to assign a value to a variable, but I find it makes my code a bit confusing, because
there is also `==`, which tests for equality.

```{r}
sumOfTwoNumbers <- 1 + 2
```
Once we have something assigned to a variable, we can use it in other expressions:

```{r}
sumOfThreeNumbers <- sumOfTwoNumbers + 3
```
This is the bare basics of assignment. We'll use it in the next exercises to evaluate the output
of our `dplyr` cleaning.

*** =instructions
+ Assign `newValue` the value of `10`. 
+ Then use `newValue` to calculate the value of `multValue` by calculating `newValue * 5`. 
+ Show `multValue`.

*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}

```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
##assign newValue
newValue <-
## use newValue to calculate multValue
multValue <- 
##show multValue
multValue
```

*** =solution
```{r}
##assign newValue
newValue <- 10
## use newValue to calculate multValue
multValue <- newValue * 5
##show multValue
```

*** =sct
```{r}
success_msg("Now you know how to assign variables and use them in expressions. Well done!")
test_object("newValue", incorrect_msg = "Not quite. Did you assign `newValue` to 10?")
test_object("multValue", incorrect_msg = "Not quite. Did you use `newValue` in your expression?")
```

## Let's look at some data and ways to manipulate it.

We're going to use the `biopics` dataset in the `fivethirtyeight` package to do learn `dplyr`. This is a dataset of 761 different biopic movies. 

This is how we loaded the data into the session. Note that I've already done this for you, so you don't need to do this.

```{r}
#load fivethirtyeight package
library(fivethirtyeight)
#access biopics data
data(biopics)
```

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(dplyr)

data(biopics)
biopics$country <- factor(biopics$country)
```

*** =instructions
+ Run a `summary` on the `biopics` dataset. It's already loaded up for you. 
+ How many categories are in the `country` variable?

*** =hint
Use the `levels()` function.

*** =sample_code
```{r}
##run summary here

##show length of country categories here

```

*** =solution
```{r}
##run summary here
summary(biopics)
##length of country category here
length(levels(biopics$country))
```

*** =sct
```{r}
success_msg("Nice work!")
test_function("summary", incorrect_msg = "you need to use the summary() function on biopics")
test_function("levels", incorrect_msg = "you need to use the levels() function on biopics$country")

```


--- type:NormalExercise lang:r xp:100 skills:1 key:1929755973
## dplyr::filter()

`filter()` is a very useful `dplyr` command. It allows you to subset a `data.frame` based on variable criteria.

For example, if we wanted to subset `biopics` to those movies that were made in the `UK` we'd use the following statement:

```{r}
#subset the data using filter
biopicsUK <- filter(biopics, country=="UK")
#confirm that we have subsetted correctly
biopicsUK
```

Three things to note here: 

+ The first argument to `filter()` is the dataset. We'll see another variation of this in a second.
+ For those who are used to accessing `data.frame` variables by `$`, notice we don't have to use `biopics$country`. Instead, we can just use the variable name `country`.
+ Our filter statement uses `==`. Remember that `==` is an equality test, and `=` is to assign something. (confusing the two will happen to you from time to time.)

*** =instructions
+ Filter `biopics` so that it only shows `Criminal` movies (you'll have to use the `type_of_subject` variable in `biopics`. 
+ Show how many rows are left using `nrow(crimeMovies)`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(dplyr)

data(biopics)
biopics$country <- factor(biopics$country)
options(tibble.width = Inf)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
#add your filter statement here
crimeMovies <- filter()

#show number of crime movies
```

*** =solution
```{r}
#add your filter statement here
crimeMovies <- filter(biopics, type_of_subject == "Criminal")

#show number of crime movies
nrow(crimeMovies)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
success_msg("Good job! That's the right number.")
test_function("filter", incorrect_msg = "Did you try using the `filter()` function?")
test_object("crimeMovies", incorrect_msg = "Your filter statement is incorrect. Try again.")
test_function("nrow", incorrect_msg = "You should use `nrow()` to show the number of rows in `crimeMovies`")

```


--- type:NormalExercise lang:r xp:100 skills:1 key:119cf149a3
## Comparison operators and chaining comparisons

Let's look at the following `filter()` statement:

```{r}
filter(biopics, year_release > 1980 & 
    type_of_subject == "Criminal")
```

Three things to note:

+ We used the comparison operator `>`. The basic comparisons you'll use are `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `==` (equals to) and `!=` (not equal to) 
+ We also chained on another expression, `type_of_subject == "Criminal"` using `&` (and). The other chaining operator that you'll use is `|`, which corresponds to OR. 
+ Chaining expressions is where `filter()` becomes super powerful. However, it's also the source of headaches, so you will need to carefully test your chain of expressions.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(dplyr)

data(biopics)
biopics$country <- factor(biopics$country)
options(tibble.width = Inf)
```

*** =instructions
+ Add another comparison to the chain using `&`. Use `person_of_color == FALSE`. 
+ Show how many rows are left from your filter statement.

*** =sample_code
```{r}
#add your comparison to the end of this filter statement
crimeFilms <- filter(biopics, year_release > 1980 & 
    type_of_subject == "Criminal")
    
#show number of rows in crimeFilms

```

*** =solution
```{r}
#add your comparison to the end of this filter statement
crimeFilms <- filter(biopics, year_release > 1980 & 
    type_of_subject == "Criminal" & person_of_color == FALSE)

#show number of rows in crimeFilms
nrow(crimeFilms)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
success_msg("Good job! Now you know how to chain comparisons!")
test_object("crimeFilms", incorrect_msg = "Not quite. Did you add your comparison correctly?")
test_function("nrow", incorrect_msg = "Show the number of rows in the crimeFilms using `nrow()`")
```

## Quick Quiz about Chaining Comparisons

Which statement should be the larger subset? Try them out in the console if you're not sure.

*** =instructions
- `filter(biopics, year_release > 1980 & type_of_subject == "criminal")`
- `filter(biopics, year_release > 1980 | type_of_subject == "criminal")`

*** =hint
Think about the difference between `|` (or) and `&` (and)

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(dplyr)

data(biopics)
biopics$country <- factor(biopics$country)
options(tibble.width = Inf)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
success_msg("Good Job! Let's move on.")
test_mc(correct = 2, feedback_msgs = c("Nope. This should be the smaller subset (because you're applying both criteria)",
"Correct! Because you accept either criteria, this is the larger subset"))
```

## The %in% operator

What if you wanted to select for multiple values? You can use the `%in%` operator. Here we
put the values into a `vector` with the `c()` function, which concatentates the
values together into a form that R can manipulate. Note that these values have to be exact.

```{r}
biopicsUSUK <- biopics %>% filter(country %in% c("US", "UK"))
```

*** =instructions
+ Pick out the `Musician`, `Artist` and `Singer` movies from `type_of_subject`. 
+ Assign the output to `biopicsArt`.

*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(dplyr)

data(biopics)
biopics$country <- factor(biopics$country)
biopics$type_of_subject <- factor(biopics$type_of_subject)
options(tibble.width = Inf)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
biopicsArt <- biopics %>%
```

*** =solution
```{r}
biopicsArt <- biopics %>% filter(type_of_subject %in% c("Musician", "Artist", "Singer"))
```

*** =sct
```{r}
success_msg("Now you know how to filter on multiple values! Let's move on.")
test_object("biopicsArt", incorrect_msg = "Not Quite.")
```

## Removing Missing Values

One trick you can use `filter()` for is to remove missing values. Usually missing values are
coded as `NA` in data. You can remove rows that contain `NAs` by using `is.na()`. For example:

```{r}
filter(biopics, !is.na(box_office))
```

Note the `!` in front of `is.na(box_office)`. This `!` is known as the NOT operator. Basically,
it switches the values in our `is.na` statement, making everything that was `TRUE` into `FALSE`, 
and everything `FALSE` into `TRUE`. We want to keep everything that is not `NA`, so that's why 
we use the `!`. 

*** =instructions
+ Filter `biopics` to remove the NAs, and assign the output to `filteredBiopics`. 
+ Compare the number of rows in `biopics` to `filteredBiopics`. 
+ How many missing values did we remove?

*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(dplyr)

data(biopics)
biopics$country <- factor(biopics$country)
options(tibble.width = Inf)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
filteredBiopics <- filter()

#show number of rows in biopics

#show number of rows in filteredBiopics

```

*** =solution
```{r}
filteredBiopics <- filter(biopics, !is.na(box_office))

#show number of rows in biopics
nrow(biopics)
#show number of rows in filteredBiopics
nrow(filteredBiopics)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
success_msg("Now you know how to filter out missing values! Let's move on.")
test_object("filteredBiopics", incorrect_msg = "Did you use !is.na() correctly?")
test_function("nrow", incorrect_msg = "Did you call `nrow()`?")
```

## dplyr::mutate()

`mutate()` is one of the most useful `dplyr` commands. You can use it to transform data 
(variables in your `data.frame`) and  add it as a new variable into the `data.frame`. 
For example, let's calculate the total `box_office` divided by the `number_of_subjects` 
to normalize our comparison as `normalized_box_office`: 

```{r}
biopics2 <- mutate(biopics, normalized_box_office = box_office/number_of_subjects)
```
What did we do here? First, we used the `mutate()` function to add a new column into our 
`data.frame` called `normalized_box_office`. This new variable is calculated per row by dividing
`box_office` by `number_of_subjects`.

*** =instructions
+ Try defining a new variable `race_and_gender` by pasting together `subject_race` and `subject_sex`
into a new `data_frame` called `biopics2`. 
+ Show the first few rows using `head()` so you can confirm that you added this new variable correctly.

Remember, you can use the `paste()` function to paste two strings together.

*** =hint
`paste(subject_race, subject_sex)`

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(dplyr)

data(biopics)
biopics$country <- factor(biopics$country)
options(tibble.width = Inf)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
#assign new variable race_and_gender here using mutate()
biopics2 <- mutate()

#show first rows of biopics2 using head()

```

*** =solution
```{r}
#assign new variable race_and_gender here using mutate()
biopics2 <- mutate(biopics, race_and_gender = paste(subject_race, subject_sex))

#show first rows using head
head(biopics2)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
success_msg("Great! Now you know how to use `mutate()`!")
test_object("biopics2", incorrect_msg = "Not quite. Did you use `paste()`?")
test_function("head", incorrect_msg = "Almost there. Did you use `head()`")
```


--- type:NormalExercise lang:r xp:100 skills:1 key:dfc4eaade1
## You can use mutated variables right away!

The nifty thing about `mutate()` is that once you define the variables in the statement,
you can use them right away, in the same `mutate` statement. For example, look at this code:

```{r}
mutate(biopics, box_office_year = year_release * box_office, box_office_subject = paste0(box_office_year, subject))
```

Notice that we first defined `box_office_year` in the first part of the `mutate()` statement,
and then used it right away to define a new variable, `box_office_subject`. 

*** =instructions
+ Define another variable called `box_office_y_s_num` in the same `mutate()` statement by taking  `box_office_year` and dividing it by `number_of_subjects`. 
+ Assign the output to `mutatedBiopics`.

*** =hint
Add `box_office_y_s_num=box_office_year/number_of_subjects` to the statement below.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(dplyr)

data(biopics)
biopics$country <- factor(biopics$country)
options(tibble.width = Inf)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
mutatedBiopics <- mutate(biopics, box_office_year = year_release * box_office, box_office_subject = paste0(box_office_year, subject))
```

*** =solution
```{r}
mutatedBiopics <- mutate(biopics, box_office_year = year_release * box_office, box_office_subject = paste0(box_office_year, subject), 
box_office_y_s_num = box_office_year/number_of_subjects)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
success_msg("You used a variable that was defined in a mutate statement. Great!")
test_object("mutatedBiopics", incorrect_msg = "Not quite. Did you define a new variable?")
```

## Another Use for `mutate()`

What is this statement doing? Try it out in the console if you're not sure.

```{r}
mutate(biopics, subject= paste(subject, year_release))
```

*** =instructions
- We are defining a brand-new variable with the same name in our dataset and keeping the old variable as well
- We are processing the variable `subject` and saving it in place

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(dplyr)

data(biopics)
biopics$country <- factor(biopics$country)
options(tibble.width = Inf)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
success_msg("Great! Now you know you can also use `mutate()` to process variables in place.")
msg1 = "Try it out. Did we add another variable?"
msg2 = "Correct! We're processing `subject` in place."
test_mc(correct=2, feedback_msgs = c(msg1, msg2))
```


--- type:MultipleChoiceExercise lang:r xp:50 skills:1 key:3b247ce89c
## The difference between `filter()` and `mutate()`

What is the difference between these two statements? Try them out in the console if you're not sure.

```{r}
biopics %>% filter(year_release > 1998)
```

```{r}
biopics %>% mutate(isNewer = year_release > 1998)
```

*** =instructions
- The first statement should have a larger number of rows than the second one
- The first statement filters the data, whereas the second statement defines a new boolean variable.
- The second statement is more confusing.

*** =hint
Compare the number of rows and the output of each of these statements.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(dplyr)

data(biopics)
biopics$country <- factor(biopics$country)
options(tibble.width = Inf)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
success_msg("Yes! I'm glad you understand the difference.")
msg1 = "Not the case! Try comparing the number of rows."
msg2 = "Yes, this is correct! We're identifying a new variable that we can use to flag the data."
msg3 = "It is a little confusing, but think it out."
test_mc(correct = 2, feedback_msgs = c(msg1, msg2, msg3))
```

## The Pipe Operator: %>%

We're going to introduce another bit of `dplyr` syntax, the `%>%` operator. `%>%` is called a `pipe` operator. 
You can think of it as being similar to the `+` in a `ggplot2` statement.

What `%>%` does is that it takes the output of one statement and makes it the input of the next statement. When 
I'm describing it, I think of it as a "THEN". For example, I read the following expression

```{r}
biopics %>% filter(race_known == "Known") %>%
    mutate(poc_code = as.numeric(person_of_color))
```
As: I took the `biopics` data, THEN 
I filtered it down with the `race_known == "Known"` criteria and THEN 
I defined a new variable called `poc_code`.

Note that `filter()` doesn't have a `data` argument, because the `data` is `piped` into `filter()`. Same thing for `mutate()`.

`%>%` allows you to chain multiple verbs in the `tidyverse`. It's one of the most powerful things about the `tidyverse`. In fact,
having a standardized chain of processing actions is called a **pipeline**. Making pipelines for a data
format is great, because you can apply that pipeline to incoming data that has the same formatting and have it output in a `ggplot2` friendly format.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)

data(biopics)
options(tibble.width = Inf)
```

*** =sample_code```{r}

    biopics %>%
```

*** =type1:NormalExercise
*** =key1: e0b8c4068c
*** =xp1: 100

*** =instructions1
+ Use `%>%` to chain `biopics` into a `filter` to select (`country=="US"`)

*** =key2: 7a97ffb1f6
*** =xp2: 100

*** =instructions2
Let's put another verb into `filter`: `str_detect()` If you use this in a `filter` statement, you
can use it to search for a string within a variable. 

Add this to your dplyr statement (don't forget the `%>%`):

```
filter(str_detect(lead_actor_actress, "Richard"))
```

*** =solution2
```{r}
richardUS <- 
    biopics %>% filter(country=="US") %>%
     filter(str_detect(lead_actor_actress, "Richard"))

```

*** =sct2
```{r}
test_object("richardUS", incorrect_msg="Not quite. Add the above filter() statement")

```


--- type:NormalExercise lang:r xp:100 skills:1 key:8c5431911a
## group_by()/summarize()

`group_by()` doesn't do anything by itself. But when combined with `summarize()`, you can 
calculate metrics (such as `mean`, `max` - the maximum, `min`, `sd` - the standard deviation) across groups. For example:

```{r}
countryMeans <- biopics %>% 
                    filter(!is.na(box_office)) %>% 
                    group_by(country) %>% 
                    summarize(mean_box_office = mean(box_office))
```

Here we want to calculate the mean `box_office` by `country`. However, in order to do that, we first need to remove
any rows that have `NA` values in `box_office` that may confound our calculation.

*** =instructions
Let's ask a tough question. Is there a difference between mean `box_office` 
between the two `subject_sex` categories? 

First use `filter()` to remove the NA values. Then, use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to 
calculate the mean `box_office` by `subject_sex`, naming the summary
variable as `mean_bo_by_gender`.  Assign the output to `gender_box_office`. 

*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(dplyr)

data(biopics)
options(tibble.width = Inf)
```

*** =sample_code

gender_box_office <- biopics %>% 
    filter() %>%
    group_by() %>% 
    summarize(mean_bo_by_gender=)
    
##show gender_box_office
head(gender_box_office)
```

*** =solution
```{r}
gender_box_office <- biopics %>% 
    filter(!is.na(box_office)) %>%
    group_by(subject_sex) %>% 
    summarize(mean_bo_by_gender=mean(box_office))

##show gender_box_office
head(gender_box_office)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
success_msg("Yes! You're summarizing like crazy! Let's move on.")
test_object("gender_box_office", incorrect_msg = "almost, but not quite! Check each dplyr verb to make sure it's correct.")
```

## arrange()

`arrange()` lets you sort by a variable. If you provide multiple variables, the variables are 
arranged within each other. For example:

```{r}
biopics %>% arrange(country, year_release)
```

This statement will sort the data by `country` first, and then within each `country` category, 
it will sort by `year_release`.

*** =instructions
Sort `biopics` by `year_release` then by `lead_actor_actress`. Assign the output to `biopics_sorted`.

## select()

The final verb we'll learn is `select()`. `select()` allows you to 1) extract columns, 
2) reorder columns or 3) remove columns from your data, as well as 4) rename your data. 
For example, look at the following code:

```{r}
biopics %>% select(movieTitle=title, box_office)
```
Here, we're just extracting two columns (`title_of_movie`, `box_office`). Notice we also renamed
`title` to `movieTitle`.

*** =instructions
Use `select` to extract the following variables: `title` (rename it `movieTitle`), 
`box_office` and `subject_sex` and assign them to a new table called `threeVarTable`

*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)

## Chester Ismay's Mantra

What is the difference between `select()` and `filter()?`

*** =instructions
- `select()` works on booleans, whereas `filter()` works on all data types
- `select()` only works after `filter()`
- `select()` works on columns, `filter()` works on rows

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}

```

*** =sct
```{r}
success_msg("Welcome to the cult of `dplyr`! Your secret decoder ring is in the mail.")
msg1 <- "Nope. Both of these verbs don't care what data type you use."
msg2 <- "Not true. You can use `filter()` and `select()` in any order!"
msg3 <- "Yup. Repeat this 10 times every day so you know the difference."

## Putting it all together: Challenge 1

Now here comes the fun part. Chaining `dplyr` verbs together to accomplish some
data cleaning and transformation.

For a reference while you work, you can use the `dplyr` cheatsheet here: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(dplyr)

data(biopics)
biopics$country <- factor(biopics$country)
options(tibble.width = Inf)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
biopics_by_country <- biopics %>%
```

*** =type1:NormalExercise
*** =key1: e453083e3c

*** =xp1: 100

*** =instructions1
For the `biopics` data, `filter()` the data so that we only cover movies from 2000 to 2014. Then 
use `mutate()` to code a new variable, `box_office_per_subject`. 

*** =solution1
```{r}
biopics_by_country <- biopics %>%
    filter(year_release >= 2000 & year_release <= 2014) %>%
    mutate(box_office_per_subject = box_office / number_of_subjects) 
```

*** =sct1
```{r}
test_object("biopics_by_country", incorrect_msg="Almost - did you set up your `filter()` and your `mutate()` statement?")
```

*** =type2:NormalExercise
*** =key2: 5a8228cb3c
*** =key2: 0d53edf905

*** =xp2: 100

*** =instructions2
Now `filter` to remove the NA values in`box_office_per_subject` and `group_by()` `country` and `summarize()` the mean `box_office_per_subject` by `country` as `bops_by_country`.

*** =solution2
```{r}
biopics_by_country <- biopics %>%
    filter(year_release >= 2000 & year_release <= 2014) %>%
    mutate(box_office_per_subject = box_office / number_of_subjects) %>%
    filter(!is.na(box_office_per_subject)) %>%
    group_by(country) %>%
    summarize(bops_by_country = mean(box_office_per_subject))
```

*** =sct2
```{r}
# no sct yet
```

*** =type3:NormalExercise
*** =key3: d017afe283
*** =key3: 006e415450

*** =xp3: 100

*** =instructions3

Finally, arrange `biopics_by_country` by your new `bops_by_country` variable.

*** =solution3

```{r}
biopics_by_country <- biopics %>%
    filter(year_release >= 2000 & year_release <= 2014) %>%
    mutate(box_office_per_subject = box_office / number_of_subjects) %>%
    filter(!is.na(box_office_per_subject)) %>%
    group_by(country) %>%
    summarize(bops_by_country = mean(box_office_per_subject)) %>%
    arrange(bops_by_country)
```

*** =sct3
```{r}
success_msg("Wow! You've really come really far. I bestow upon you the title of `dplyr` ninja!")
test_object("biopics_by_country", incorrect_msg = "Not quite. Check your code.")

```

## Challenge 2: Show your stuff

Answer the question: Do movies where we know the race is known (`race_known` == TRUE) make more 
money than movies where the race is not known (`race_known`== FALSE) grouped by country? 
Which `race_known`/`country` combination made the highest amount of money?

*** =instructions
+ You'll need to do a `filter` step first to remove `NA` values from `box_office` before you do  anything. 
+ Then think of what variables you need to `group_by`. 
+ Finally, figure out what do you need to `summarize` (assign the value to `mean_box_office`) 
and `arrange` on (don't forget to use `desc`!)? 
+ Assign the output to `race_country_box_office`.

*** =hint
You can do this!

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(dplyr)

data(biopics)
biopics$country <- factor(biopics$country)
options(tibble.width = Inf)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
race_country_box_office <- biopics %>%
        
```

*** =solution
```{r}
race_country_box_office <- biopics %>%
    filter(!is.na(box_office)) %>%
    group_by(race_known, country) %>%
    summarize(mean_box_office=mean(box_office)) %>%
    arrange(desc(mean_box_office))
```

*** =sct
```{r}
success_msg("Your `dplyr` skills are ever improving!")
test_object("race_country_box_office", incorrect_msg = 
    "Not quite. Think about the order in which you need to do these operations.")
```

## Challenge 3: Putting together what we know about ggplot2 and dplyr

Now we're cooking with fire. You can directly pipe the output of a `dplyr` pipeline
into a `ggplot2` statement. For example:

```{r}
biopics %>%
    filter(year_release >= 2000 & year_release <= 2014) %>%
    mutate(box_office_per_subject = box_office / number_of_subjects) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = year_release, y=box_office_per_subject)) +
    geom_point()
```

Note that we use `%>%` to pipe our statement into the `ggplot()` function. The
tricky thing to remember is that everything after the `ggplot()` is connected with
`+`, and not `%>%`. 

Also note: we don't assign a `data` variable in the `ggplot()` statement. We are piping
in the data. 

*** =instructions
Are you sick of `biopics` yet? I promise this is the last time we use this dataset.

+ First, filter `biopics` to have `year_release` < 1990 and remove `NA` values. 
+ Then pipe that into a `ggplot()` statement that plots an x-y plot of `box_office` 
(use `geom_point()`) where `x=year_release` and `y=log(box_office)`. 
+ Color the points by `person_of_color`. 
+ Assign the output to `bPlot` and print it to the screen using `print(bPlot)`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

data(biopics)
biopics$country <- factor(biopics$country)
options(tibble.width = Inf)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
bPlot <- biopics %>%

print(bPlot)
```

*** =solution
```{r}
bPlot <- biopics %>% filter(year_release < 1990) %>% filter(!is.na(box_office)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=year_release, y=log(box_office), color=person_of_color)) +
    geom_point()
    
print(bPlot)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
success_msg("Now you know how to chain dplyr statements straight into a ggplot!")
#test_ggplot(index = 0, check_aes = TRUE, aes_fail_msg = "Make sure you're mapping the right variables")
#test_ggplot(index=0, check_data = TRUE, data_fail_msg = "Did you do the filter step correctly?")
```
